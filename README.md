# Quick Racing

### Material

- Get a D6 die.
- Get any small objects to symbolize your drivers/runners/cars/horses... (pawns, miniatures, small lego build, cut out drawing...).
- Draw a circuit with squares or just grab a ruler to run straight on a table, with a start position and an ending line.

### Setup

- Place all characters on the starting position.
- Decide who play first.

### Rules

Roll the die. If you get a 6 re-roll until you get a different result. Once you have a number between 1 and 5 , decide to move your character the amount you got or roll again to try to go farther. Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you get a 6. If you decide to stop, move your character the same amount of squares/centimeters as the sum of the rolls. If you got a 6, move your character the same amount as the number of times you rolled the die (excluding initial re-roll(s) caused by an early 6).
