# Quick Racing

### Overview

Simple and free racing game.

Age: 5+

Players: 2+

### Material

- Get a D6 die.
- Get any small objects to symbolize your drivers/runners/cars/horses... (pawns, miniatures, small lego build, cut out drawing...).
- Draw a circuit with squares or just grab a ruler to run straight on a table, with a start position and an ending line.

### Setup

- Place all characters on the starting position.
- Decide who play first.

### Rules

Roll the die. If you get a 6 re-roll until you get a different number. Once you have a number between 1 and 5, decide to move your character the amount you got or roll again to try to go farther. Continue this process until you decide to stop or until you get a 6. If you decide to stop, move your character the same amount of squares/centimeters as the sum of all rolls. If you get a 6, move your character the number of times you rolled the die (excluding initial re-roll(s) caused by an early 6).
